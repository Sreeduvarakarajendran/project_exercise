    <p style = "color: chartreuse; text-align: center;">Sweetheart, I wanted to write you a love letter. I know it’s a little silly, but I’d try anyway. It’s just that I feel so much when I’m with you that I try to put it in words so that you know how I feel about you. You are such a gift to me. Having you in my life is such a blessing.</p>
